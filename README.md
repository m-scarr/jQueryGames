# jQuery Games

These were assignments, I added a few mechanics/ features to them to spice them up.

## Hangman

This only features 3 questions, but as a bonus, I had the app draw the man that may or may not be hung!

  ### What's Next?
  
  I want to change the data structure of questions and answers, and I could cut the lines of code in half if I looked into it.
  
  
  
## Crystal Collector

The instructions for this game are on the page with it. I made this one with bootstrap, and decided to add a `pay-to-win` mechanic as a joke, enjoy!

  ### What's Next?
  I want to tidy up the code a bit, but it's mostly done.
  
  
  
## Psychic Game
You have 7 tries to guess what letter the computer has thought up! Good luck!

  ### What's Next
  I don't have a lot of interest in doing anything with this. It was a great learning experience though.
